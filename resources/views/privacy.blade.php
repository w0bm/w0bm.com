<h5>What do we log?</h5>
<p>Anything our Nginx logs within it's logs, however there are no user-account bound ip adresses.</p>
<p>We value your privacy and will never give out any user data or sell user data (implying someone would really want to buy this shit anyways lol)</p>
<p>We don't want to know who you are!</p>
<h5>Why do we log?</h5>
<p>Simply to prevent abuse.</p>
<h5>³rd party links</h5>
<p>There a some 3rd party linkings on this website, be careful with clicking them we don't know whats inside the box blah blah blah, don't be stupid and don't trust the internet.</p>
<p>We also use a webfont from google fonts, if you don't like that go fuck yourself or block it with umatrix.</p>
