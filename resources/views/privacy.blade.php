<p>We take your privacy serious!</p>
<p>We do NOT keep any activity logs!</p>
<p>We also do NOT log any IPs with our webserver, we don't need this data and so we don't see any reason to log it</p>
<p>The only thing we do log is your user information you give us while registering, this includes your email address, your username and your password.</p>
<p>We don't want to know who you are, we just want to provide a good service for you</p>
