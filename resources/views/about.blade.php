<h4 class="filtersettings">Filter settings</h4>
<p style="color:red;">Filter is now global and not logged in users will only see sfw videos</p>
<p>You can also set your own custom filters by clicking on Filter and then inserting the tags you don't want to see while browsing.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="about-tags">
<span class="tag label label-info">anime</span> <span class="tag label label-info">asians</span> <span class="tag label label-info">Crayon Pop</span> <span class="tag label label-info">gay</span>
</div>
<p>You will see that our videos are tagged with either <span class="label label-default" style="color:#23ff00">sfw</span> or <span class="label label-default" style="color:red">nsfw</span> these labels mean in nearly 99% of the case at least for uploads tagged with nsfw that they are nsfw, but the sfw tag isn't always sfw and you shouldn't think that we really care about this, there is probably a lot of content which is not tagged as nsfw but still is nsfw.</p>
<p>Always take care and when you are not sure if you can browse w0bm at work, don't do it, we don't guarantee that everything is properly tagged and you will encounter something that can get you in trouble.</p>

<h4>FAQ</h4>
<p>Q: w0bm is laggy for me and I don't know why.</p>
<p>A: It's mostly because of the background. It's very resource heavy and can cause lag on some computers, if you experience this, you should click the yellow lightbulb on the video page to turn it off <i style="color:#fff200;" class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i></p>
<p>Q: I don't know how to create WebMs</p>
<p>A: Check out our <a href="/webm">WebM support</a> page and pick the solution you like the most!</p>
<p>Q: Can you allow mp4s to be uploaded?</p>
<p>A: Why do you think this website is called w0bm?</p>
<p>Q: I want to give you guys some feedback and maybe some suggestions, where should I go?</p>
<p>A: You can open a issue on our <a href="https://github.com/w0bm/">Github repository</a> and write down what you want to have as a feature and maybe it will happen some day, there is no guarantee since we are all lazy as fuck, or you can come directly to the <a href="/community">IRC/Discord</a> and tell us instantly!</p>
