        <h4>Rules for w0bm.com</h4>
</div>
<h5>General</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Content on this site is intended for people over the age of 18 only! If you are under 18 you have to leave, if I will find out you are under 18 your account will be banned permanently.</li>
	<li>Leaking of private information is strictly forbidden. This environment is friendly!</li>
	<li>Do not talk about crimes you commited or will commit, we don't want to know.</li>
	<li>Do not try to sell, buy, or spread credit-card, banking etc. info anywhere on this site.</li>
	<li>Do not animate people to do crimes or anything illegal!</li>
	<li>If you upload something always try to give the artist credits by linking to the original, filling out the Artist & Songitle Information for example.</li>
	<li>You are not allowed to leech all of our videos unless you asked us for permission, traffic is very expensive and when we see unusual traffic spikes we will enable logging and ban the complete subnet of your provider, it happened before. Just come to the IRC and ask us for permission, it's that simple!</li>
</ol>

<h5>Uploading</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Everything you upload <strong style="color:#1FB2B0;">must</strong> be acceptable with Moldovian law!</li>
	<li>Absolutely no child pornography in any way! This also includes "modeling" and 3D loli videos. 2D (hentai) is okay.</li>
	<li>Reposting is not a crime! But in most cases it can be prevented with the use of the <a href="https://w0bm.com/index">search form</a>.
	<li>Put your uploads in the correct category, if you have a video that doesn't fit in any of the categories always put it in the Misc category</li.>
	<li>The focus is on videos you can easily watch 200 times a day over and over so upload only catchy shit! For example: <a href="/39">/39</a></li>
	<li>The Artist and Songtitle field is only for the Artist and Song information respectively, anything else in there probably doesn't belong in there, use the Tags.</li>
	<li>The Video Source field is not intended for YouTube Links or any other kind of link, please put only text in there. For example: YouTube and then put the YouTube link in the comments, if you fail at this too often it will probably hurt my vagina and I will scream like a 12 year old princess. Thanks! :3</li>
	<li>No Politics Videos without any entertainment value, and I define the value and talks from Trump and the other shitheads is no entertainment, please delete yourself.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Tagging</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Tags should always describe the video.</li>
	<li>No links in the Tags, use the comment section for that!</li>
	<li>Always give your video a rating like "sfw" or "nsfw" so people can filter.</li>
	<li>Please don't tag too much shit, thanks.</li>
	<li>Comments are not welcome in the Tag section, if we catch you say goodbye.</li>
</ol>
	
<h5>Commenting</h5>
<ol>
	<li>You don't have to be polite, but you also don't have to be an asshole.</li>
	<li>NSFW images should only be posted on NSFW videos.</li>
	<li>Live with different opinions, and deal with it.</li>
	<li>Fucking a mother is 2009-tier</li>
</ol>

<h5>Reposts</h5>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Tag reposts with the tag: repost also link the original and the repost in the comments, maybe some admin or moderator is going to care about it and deletes the repost.</li>
</ul>
